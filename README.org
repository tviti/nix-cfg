#+title: Declarative system configuration via Nix
#+author: Taylor Viti (tviti@hawaii.edu)

* Abstract
  The files contained in this folder define a system configuration using the
  nix language, that can be implemented using a combination of [[https://nixos.org/nix/][nix]] (the package
  manager), [[https://github.com/rycee/home-manager][home_manager]], and [[https://github.com/LnL7/nix-darwin][nix-darwin]].

* How
  I try to implement as many things as possible using home_manager (as opposed
  to nix-darwin), so as to make this environment as operating system agnostic
  as possible. Because nix-darwin is a nixos emulation layer for macOS,
  things implemented using nix-darwin are at best portable to nixOS systems.

* Folders
  - config: Misc. dotfiles that should be symlinked by home_manager. Also an
    appropriate place to place =.nix= files that manage user level configs.
  - machines: Machine specific files (e.g. =configuration.nix= and =home.nix=).
  - overlays: Nix overlays (includes a clone of [[https://github.com/nix-community/emacs-overlay][emacs-overlay]]).
  - pkgs: Custom package definitions.
  - services: System level service definitions.
  - nix-src: Source repos for nix tooling (e.g. home-manager).
* $NIX_PATH
  I am currently experimenting with keeping local copies of the nixpkgs,
  home_manager, and nix-darwin repos (located in =./nix-src=), with all
  nix-channels removed. I haven't tried to boostrap this config on a system that
  didn't already have nix and home_manager installed (/yet/), but keep in mind
  that on the first invocation of =darwin-rebuild switch= or =home-manager
  switch=, nix will have no idea where to locate these things. The simplest way
  to deal with this (assuming the tools are already installed) seems to be
  passing them explicitly:

  #+begin_src bash
    darwin-rebuild switch -I darwin=<path/to/nix-darwin> -I home-manager=<path/to/home-manager> -I nixpkgs=<path/to/nixpkgs>
  #+end_src
  
  after which =$NIX_PATH= should have been properly set for all future
  invocations of =darwin-rebuild= and =home-manager=. On a non-NixOS linux
  system, where we can't system level configuration, we'd probably want to set
  these using home_manager, for example as

  #+begin_src nix
    home.sessionVariables = {
      NIX_PATH = "$NIX_PATH:nixpkgs=<path/to/nixpkgs>:home-manager=<path/to/home-manager>";
    };
  #+end_src

  but I'm filing this under "cross that bridge when we get there", since I'm
  reluctant to muck with =$NIX_PATH= in multiple places.
