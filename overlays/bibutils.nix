/* An overlay for building bibutils on Darwin systems. Note that
   nixpkgs.bibutils is listed as linux ONLY, so here we override both the
   version (nixpkgs is also behind), the allowed platforms, and then disable
   tests (for some reason, build goes OK, but tests fail, usually for intlib.c).

   Although some of the tests fail, my experience using ris2xml | xml2bib to
   convert .ris formatted citations seem to suggest everything is reasonably
   well behaved (fingers crossed).
