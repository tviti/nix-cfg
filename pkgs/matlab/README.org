#+title: MATLAB on nixos

You can perform an /impure/ MATLAB installation using the FHS env provided by
=shell.nix=. Drop into the shell by calling ~$ nix-shell~, and then into the FHS
environment by calling ~$ matlab-shell~. Then, run the MATLAB installer, and
follow the instructions. When prompted for an install location, select a
user-writable directory, and then edit ~version~ and ~runPath~ in =common.nix=
to reflect your choice (the default is =$HOME/MATLAB/R2019b=.
