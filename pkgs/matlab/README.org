#+title: MATLAB on nixos

You can perform an /impure/ MATLAB installation using the FHS env provided by
=shell.nix=. Drop into the shell by calling ~$ nix-shell~, and then into the FHS
environment by calling ~$ matlab-shell~. Then, run the MATLAB installer, and
follow the instructions. When prompted for an install location, select a
user-writable directory, and then edit ~version~ and ~runPath~ in =common.nix=
to reflect your choice (the default is =$HOME/MATLAB/R2019b=).

In order to get the documentation browser working in =R2020a=, I also had to
exclude the following libraries from those shipped by MATLAB:

- gio
- glib
- gthread
- gobject
- gmodule

These libraries are found in =~/MATLAB/R2020a/cefclient/sys/os/glnxa64=. To
exclude them, create a folder =Exclude= in that directory, and just move the
associated shared-object files and symlinks into =Exclude=. When I was done, the
only thing left was =libffi=.
